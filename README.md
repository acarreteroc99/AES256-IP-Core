# AES256-HW-Accelerator
AES256 hardware accelerator connected to a core using the RISC-V ISA

## Abstract

This senior thesis aims to design, integrate and implement a hardware accelerator that, associated with a microprocessor designed by the Centro Nacional de Microelectr√≥nica (CNM) based on the RISC-V architecture, is capable of accelerating the AES-256 encryption algorithm. The main objective of this work is to produce an FPGA based on the developed design and, later, integrate the accelerator into an IoT (Internet of Things) device that is being developed by the CNM.
