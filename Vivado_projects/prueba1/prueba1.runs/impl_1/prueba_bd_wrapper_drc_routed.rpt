PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net prueba_bd_i/AES256_v2_0/inst/AES256_v2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/device/keygen/cond_getWord_reg[2]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin prueba_bd_i/AES256_v2_0/inst/AES256_v2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/device/keygen/cond_getWord_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell prueba_bd_i/AES256_v2_0/inst/AES256_v2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/device/keygen/cond_getWord_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1840#20 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 prueba_bd_i/AES256_v2_0/inst/AES256_v2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/device/decrypter/rom_Sbox/outp_romSbox_reg has an input control pin prueba_bd_i/AES256_v2_0/inst/AES256_v2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/device/decrypter/rom_Sbox/outp_romSbox_reg/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: prueba_bd_i/AES256_v2_0/inst/AES256_v2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/device/decrypter/rom_Sbox/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (prueba_bd_i/AES256_v2_0/inst/AES256_v2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/device/decrypter/reg16_3/n_read_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
